# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository. This repository contains code implementations for various data structures and algorithms as I work through learning and mastering DSA concepts.

## 📚 About

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each topic is accompanied by C++ code, comments, and examples to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the concepts are applied in solving real-world problems.

### Topics Covered:
- Linked Lists
- Arrays
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Hashing
- And more as I progress!

## 🛠️ Folder Structure

The repository will be organized into folders based on the topic or data structure being practiced.


Each folder contains C++ code that implements the relevant algorithms and data structures.

## 💻 Technologies

- Language: **C++**
- IDE: Any preferred IDE (VS Code, CLion, etc.)
- Version Control: Git, GitHub
